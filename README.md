# AIWorkbench
Artificial Intelligence Tool for creating, testing, and comparing AI Models and basic data cleaning.\
Created as my Capstone.\
Created on the goal of "Create an AI model only by loading data".

![Example](https://github.com/aidanpalmbos/AIWorkbench/blob/master/AIWorkbench/images/Example.png "Example application")

**Currently supports Sci-kit Learn's Regression Model and parameters.**

Run using `python3 AIWorkbench.py`.

Steps/tasks for using the application:\
1.) Select data using "Load Dataset".\
2.) Clean the data.\
3.) Change model parameters.\
4.) Click "Begin Training" and view results.\
5.) Retrain model or save it for use in a different project by clicking "Save Model".

_Instances_ are save points for the application:\
Once a model is trained, and you want to see the results for later, click "Save Instance".\
When you want to see these results again, click "Load Previous Instance".
