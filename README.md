# AIWorkbench
Artificial Intelligence Tool for creating, testing, and comparing AI Models and basic data cleaning.\
Created as my Capstone.\
Created on the goal of "Create a AI model only by loading data".

![Example](AIworkbench/images/Example.png "Example application")

**Currently supports Sci-kit Learn's Regression Model and parameters.**

Run using `python3 AIWorkbench.py`.

1.) Select data using "Load Dataset".\
2.) Clean the data.\
3.) Change model parameters.\
4.) Click "Begin Training" and view results.\
5.) Retrain model or save it for use in a different project by clicking "Save Model".

_Instances_ are save points for the application.
Once a model is trained, and you want to see the results for later, click "Save Instance".
When you want to see these results again, click "Load Previous Instance".
